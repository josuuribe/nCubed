### nCubed
nCubed is a DDDD (Distributed Domain Driven Design) framework that has three main parts, a [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [CQRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation#Command_Query_Responsibility_Segregation) and [EventSourcing](http://cqrs.wikidot.com/doc:event-sourcing). You can use any of them separately or in combination between them, you also can download the source code or the nuGet packages, for [DDD](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nCubed.Core/), [CQRS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nCubed.CQRS/), [EventSourcing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nCubed.ES/).

This framework has been already tested in production environments for several clients (mainly banking) but you can also use it for learning purposes if you prefer it.

Most of this work has been done using Microsoft best practices as i mention in Authors and Contributors.

It was possible to release this source code thanks to the permission of my former company [Optimissa](http://www.optimissa.net).
